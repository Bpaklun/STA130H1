    "## Research Question 1:\n",
    "**Does regularly sending check-in messages to friends or family positively influence well-being?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this research, I plan to explore if regularly sending check-in messages to friends or family has positively association with life satisfaction and inverse association with feelings of emotional loneliness.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables to Explore:**\n",
    "- **CONNECTION_activities_checked_in_p3m**\n",
    "    - How often someone has sent a text to check in with someone in the past 3 months\n",
    "- **WELLNESS_life_satisfaction**\n",
    "    - How an individual feels about their life currently\n",
    "- **LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_miss**\n",
    "    - How much an individual feels lonely\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Visualization Choices: \n",
    "- **Stacked Bar Chart**: Can be used to show the relative frequency distribution of life satisfaction and loneliness within each check-in frequency group. `CONNECTION_activities_checked_in_p3m` on the x-axis, stacked bars showing the proportions of WELLNESS_life_satisfaction and `LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_miss levels`.\n",
    "- **Color-Coded Scatter Plot**: Could show the relationship between life satisfaction and emotional loneliness levels are influenced by check-in frequency. `WELLNESS_life_satisfaction` on the x-axis and `LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_miss` on the y-axis. Color gradient to show `CONNECTION_activities_checked_in_p3m` levels\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Data\n",
    "Multiple methods of analysis can be used to clearly determine if regularly sending check-in messages to friends or family has positively association with life satisfaction and inverse association with feelings of emotional loneliness\n",
    "\n",
    "I will firstly convert my ordinal variables into numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Spearman Rank Correlation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The spearman rank of correlation determines if there is a linear correlation between two variables. Two tests can be conducted, one to find the correlation of `CONNECTION_activities_checked_in_p3m` with `WELLNESS_life_satisfaction` and then `LONELY_dejong_emotional_social_loneliness_scale_miss`. By finding Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, we can see if there is a correlation between these variables. To conduct this test, we should assume both variables should be ordinal and related monotonically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Bootstrapped Sampling and Sampling Distribution with a Hypothesis test**\n",
    "\n",
    "For the first test, I will determine whether checking in raises life satisfaction. I will first separate the sample into two groups based on `CONNECTION_activities_checked_in_p3m`, where frequent check-ins will be people who checked in above the median frequency and infrequent check-ins the people who checked in below the median frequency. I will take each group's life satisfication data perform bootstrapping and find the mean for each sample. Then I will find the difference between the means between the frequent and infrequent check in groups, and calculate the 95% confidence interval for the difference in means using the bootstrapped distribution. If the 95% confidence interval does not include 0, we reject the null hypothesis, showing that there is evidence to suggest that checking in frequently positively influences life satisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, I will determine whether or not checking in makes individuals feel less lonely. I will do the same in seperating the sample into two groups (frequent and infrequent check-ins) and then create a sampling distribution from the difference of means from bootstrapping. If the 95% confidence interval does not include 0, we reject the null hypothesis, showing that there is evidence to suggest that checking in frequently causes individuals to feel less lonely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis/results and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "If both tests are rejected, then my hypothesis will be true. If only one is rejected, it shows that one variable more or so benefits well-being, which could allow for exploration using other methods. If both are rejected, there may not be enough evidence to support the hypothesis that checking in benefits well-being. This investigation links well with the course objective, as it shows if checking in on others can lead to individuals feeling better about their life and also feel less lonely, which can benefit their well-being. If the investigation follows my hypothesis, these results can be used to raise awareness about the importance in checking in on others and finding time to engage in social interactions, which could positively affect mental health."

    "## Research Question 2:\n",
    "**Do people with higher adherence to COVID-19 prevention practices spend less time socializing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this research, I plan to explore the relationship between social interaction time with friends and COVID-19 preventive behaviors, specifically mask-wearing and physical distancing. As other studies show that socializing benefits personal well-being, I want to investigate whether or not people who have higher adherence to pandemics such as COVID-19 devalue the importance of socializing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables to Explore:**\n",
    "- **CONNECTION_social_time_friends_p7d_grouped**: \n",
    "    - Hours spent socializing with friends in the past week (continuous variable grouped into ranges like 0-1, 1-5, etc.).\n",
    "- **COVID_prevention_masks**: \n",
    "    - Frequency of wearing a mask in public (ordinal variable, possibly “Always,” “Often,” “Sometimes,” “Rarely,” and “Never”).\n",
    "- **COVID_prevention_distancing**: \n",
    "    - Frequency of practicing physical distancing in public (ordinal variable, similar scale to mask-wearing).\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Visualization Choices: \n",
    "- **Bar Chart for Social Time by Mask-Wearing Frequency**: Grouped bar chart where each bar represents a range of socializing hours, and colors represent the frequency of mask-wearing, used to show the proportions of individuals in each socializing hour category based on their adherence to mask-wearing.\n",
    "- **Bar Chart for Social Time by Distancing Frequency**: Similar to the one above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Data\n",
    "Multiple methods of analysis can be used to clearly determine if there is a relationship between time spent socializing and adherance of COVID-19:\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the prevention variables are ordinal, I will convert them into numerical format:\n",
    "\n",
    "always = 4, often = 3, sometimes = 2, rarely = 1, never = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linear Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "I will conduct two linear regression models. The dependent variable will be hours spent socializing and the independent variable is mask-wearing frequency and physical distancing frequency. I will then calculate the means of the dependent variables and independent variables, which will be used to find the best fitting line predicting socializing time based on the independent variables using least squares regression method. Using the equation I can use R-squared to determine how much of my data is explained by the independent variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "To determine whether adherence to mask-wearing influences socializing time, I will categorize individuals based on their mask-wearing frequency. I will separate the sample into two groups of those who consistently wear masks (e.g., “Always” and “Often”) and those who do not (e.g., “Sometimes,” “Rarely,” and “Never”). I will perform bootstrapping on the social time data for each group to calculate the means. After calculating the difference in means between the two groups, I will construct a 95% confidence interval for this difference. If the interval does not include 0, we will reject the null hypothesis, suggesting that higher adherence to mask-wearing correlates with reduced social time. I will do the similar steps for \"Impact of Distancing on Social Time\", where the difference in means will be analyzed to create a 95% confidence interval. If this interval excludes 0, it provides evidence to reject the null hypothesis, indicating that higher adherence to physical distancing is associated with reduced social time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis/results and discussion\n",
    "If majority of the data can be explained by the independent variables, and both hypotheses tests are rejected, then my hypothesis will be true. If only one is rejected, it shows that one variable more or so benefits well-being, which could allow for exploration using other methods. If majority of the data cannot be explained by the independent variables, and both hypothesis tests are rejected, there may not be enough evidence to support the hypothesis people who have higher adherance spend less time socializing. This investigation links well with the course objective, as it shows how people may prioritise other things over socializing, even if it is very important for our well-being. If the investigation follows my hypothesis, these results can be used to promote and create better methods in how people can socialize physically whilst maintaining high adherence to prevention practices. This may be beneficial if there ever is another pandemic."

    "## Research Question 3:\n",
    "**To what extent does the increasing use of video chats mitigate feelings of isolation, and can it serve as a substitute for in-person interactions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "For this research, I plan to explore if the increased use of video chats is inversely related to feelings of isolation, and if it can fully replace the need for in-person interactions such as meeting for coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Variables to Explore:**\n",
    "- **CONNECTION_activities_video_chat_p3m**\n",
    "    - How often people engage in activities over video chat in the past 3 months\n",
    "- **CONNECTION_activities_coffee_p3m**\n",
    "    - How often people meet to have coffee in the past 3 months\n",
    "- **LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_isolated**\n",
    "    - How often do people think they are isolated\n",
    "    \n",
    "### Visualization Choices: \n",
    "- **Scatter Plot**: `CONNECTION_activities_video_chat_p3m` (x-axis) and `LONELY_ucla_loneliness_scale_isolated` (y-axis), with a separate one for `CONNECTION_activities_coffee_p3m`. This can be used to visualize correlations and trends.\n",
    "- **Grouped Bar Charts**: Used to compare average feelings of isolation across different ranges of video chat frequency and coffee meeting frequency. Can be used to  illustrate differences in isolation levels based on interaction types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis of Data\n",
    "Multiple methods can be used to determine whether the increased use of video chats is inversely related to feelings of isolation, and if it can fully replace the need for in-person interactions such as meeting for coffee.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the prevention variables are ordinal, I will convert them into numerical format:\n",
    "\n",
    "always = 4, often = 3, sometimes = 2, rarely = 1, never = 0\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hypotheses Testing**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, I will divide the group based on their engagement of video chats, where high video chat group will consists of “Often” (4) or “Always” (5), and low video chat group as “Never” (1), “Rarely” (2), or “Sometimes” (3). I will do the same for coffee: \n",
    "- High coffee: “Often” (4) or “Always” (5)\n",
    "- Low coffee: coffee “Never” (1), “Rarely” (2), or “Sometimes” (3)\n",
    "\n",
    "I will then perform a hypotheses test using bootstrapped samples of the mean, and create a sampling distribution. Then I'll calculate the difference in means for the boostraps (Mean of High video - Mean of Low video) and (Mean of High Coffee - Mean of Low coffee). Using these values, I will use a 95% confidence interval and determine whether or not the mean includes 0. If the confidence interval does not include 0, it signifies significant change. Then I can compare both sets and see whether there is a bigger change in video chat engagers and coffee meet engagers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis/results and discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "If the video chat test is rejected, then my hypothesis is true. This implies that high video chat engagers benefit and feel less isolated. Then, after comparing it with the coffee engagers, if coffee < video chat, then it shows that video chats may be a replacement for meeting up in-person. However, if coffee > video chat, it shows that video chats are not as effective than meeting in-person, and highlights the importance for meeting up and interacting in person. This is beneficial to the course investigation, as it can be used to raise awareness on the importance of socializing, even if its online, and further highlights and encourages physical, in-person engagement and can help those who feel isolated less isolated."
